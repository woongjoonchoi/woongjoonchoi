## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing   CodingAbilityIncrease Challange

### Why do this?
If we solve a lot of different problems, we are more likely to do well when trying to solve other problems. It's not good to spend too much. We should practice while paying attention to the items below.
#### Decomposing Problem into small component
Chunking is this grouping of meaningful information. As chunking increases, so does the unit of information it understands. Therefore, software development also needs to break down the problem in detail.
#### know When to use chunk(context)
we learn when to use a particular chunking while studying the problems in which it is used and when it is not. 
#### Then , Isn't it good to solve a lot? 
Of course, It is good if you divide it into chunks, practice and solve a lot.
`However, chunks must take precedence.`
#### Logical connection between each step
For subjects like math and science, it's important to know why each next step was made. Software development is also an extension of mathematics and science, so it is necessary to logically connect each stage. Practicing this will allow you to logically connect each step later when you face different problems on your own.
